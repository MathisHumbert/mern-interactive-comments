# MERN Interactive Comments - FrontEnd Mentor

This project comes from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9) site. The goal is to create a site that manages users' invoices. So I decided to code this project myself using React for the front end and NodeJS for the back end.
